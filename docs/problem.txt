 Deliverable:

- write a REST API with two POST endpoints

- first POST endpoint receives a JSON in the form of a document with two fields: a pool-id (numeric) and a pool-values (array of values) and is meant to append (if pool already exists) or insert (new pool) the values to the appropriate pool (as per the id):

  e.g.

        {

           "poolId": 123546,

           "poolValues": [

              1,

              7,

              2,

              6

           ]

        }

- second POST is meant to query a pool, the two fields are pool-id (numeric) identifying the queried pool, and a quantile (in percentile form)

e.g.

        {

           "poolId": 123546,

           "percentile":99.5

        }

 - the response from the append is a status field confirming "appended" or "inserted".

- the response from the query has two fields: the calculated quantile and the total count of elements in the pool

- please do not use a library for the quantile calculation if a pool contains less than 100 values.

- focus on high performance if possible (time permitting) and resiliency

- reasoning about high-availability and scalability is a nice-to-have

- no database; no connection to anything needed. Keep it simple.

- your preferred language. The programming language does not need to be a systems language (that performs by definition), so no C/C++/Rust needed (unless this is your preference), really up to you (Python, Go, Java, Scala, ...).
